# What is a Niche?

Niches are segments of a market, as in "niche marketing"! How small could a segment be? It could be just you of course, these days with the big data and algorithms available online. But that is unlikely unless you are very unsual, although we are all individuals are we not?

Niches have become easier to target, based on demographics like age, sex, race, location, education, occupation, income, relationship status, or religion, beliefs and political attitudes. Also interests like sports, hobbies, or travel, beauty, fitness, diet, weight, medical conditions and other health concerns. Fashion and appearance, clothing, cosmetics or cosmetic surgery.Or financial arenas like loans, credit, mortgages, investments, and insurance - life, job, car, travel, house etc! Your job if you have one, or looking for a better one or another way to supplement income. It is almost endless.

Facebook and Google plus many others allow businesses to target more accurately, and it may be necessary to compete effectively especially for a small business. But you run the risk of alienating the "customer" with too many emails or ads, especially if inappropriate and badly timed.

Not berry nice !
